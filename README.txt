WebPage Schema Plugin allows you to use your custom full-featured schema. Schema (JSON-LD) is the most important factor in search engine optimization.

== Description ==

WebPage Schema Plugin allows you to use your custom full-featured schema. 
Schema (JSON-LD) is the most important factor in search engine optimization.
Build your custom schema for each page/post you publish in your website:
- Schema documentation https://schema.org/ or https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld11/
- Advanced SEO documentation https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/structured-data/intro-structured-data
- Schema.org Validator https://validator.schema.org/ 
- Google Rich Validator Tool (Rich Results Test) https://search.google.com/test/rich-results/result

Notes: 
- Disable schema feature from the SEO plugin that you currently use.
- Do not minify the code, plugins like autoptimize will do that job for the entire page.
